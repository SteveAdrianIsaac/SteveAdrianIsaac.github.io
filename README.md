# ICS5110 Applied Machine Learning 
Repository used for the ICS5110 Applied Machine Learning Course - part of Master's of Science in Data Science course.

We employed BiLSTM, SVM and Logistic Regression to classify news headlines. 

To test out our best models, access https://steveadrianisaac.github.io/
